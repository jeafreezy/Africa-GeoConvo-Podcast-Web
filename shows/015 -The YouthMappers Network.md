Youthmappers network is a global community of university students capitalizing on web-based open geospatial technologies to respond and address developmental needs around the globe. In this episode, we sit down with Tommy Charles, the regional ambassador for Youthmappers Sierra Leone, to talk about his journey as a youthmapper member, how to be a part of the network, and the benefits. You will also learn about the Power Mapping Grid Project where they contributed to minigrid feasibility analysis by mapping roads and buildings in rural towns in Sierra Leone.
